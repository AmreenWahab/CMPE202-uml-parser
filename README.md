# CMPE202-uml-parser

This project is to convert a input java code into UML class diagram using the following libraries and tools. 

# Libraries Used:

1. JavaParser - JavaParser is used to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree AST for the java code that it parses. The AST can then be manipulated easily to our requirements.

2. PlantUML - PlantUML helps to generate class diagram through simple language. 

3. Guava - A collection like key value pair but instead allows a single key to have multiple values.

# Tools Used:

1. Eclipse Neon IDE - The IDE used to develop this uml parser is eclipse version neon. 

2. GraphViz - This tool helps to view the UML diagram with the help of the simple language generated by the code.
